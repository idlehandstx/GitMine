  Buenos Dias!
Brand new to this type of thing.
I hope to make a future out of it.
I was a motorcycle mechanic for over 20 years and just found it time to follow
a dream i had years ago before i decided to become a grunt mechanic.
I hope to makee many new friends and finally make some real money in my life.
